    <p>We've misplaced Blitzen's Con Badge!</p>
    <p>Help us find it by looking for clues around the conspace. He's left pawprints everywhere - guess that's what happens when you have so many!</p>
    <p>If you find a pawprint, scan the QR code on it to log it. You can track your progress in your Fancy Schmancy Notebook!</p>
    <p>Having a hard time finding one? That's ok! Head to the Gaming Room and ask for a hint!</p>
